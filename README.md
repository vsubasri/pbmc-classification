# Peripheral Blood Nuclear Cells (PBMCs) Cell-Type Classification

Single-cell RNA sequencing technology quantifies transcriptomic expressions at single-cell level, leading to discoveries rooted in cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Cell-type classification, or assignment of cell type labels to single cells, is an important step in analyzing the RNA sequencing data. For example, correctly identifying cells within the tumor microenvironment can provide oncologists with a snapshot of how a patientâ€™s immune system reacts to the tumor.
